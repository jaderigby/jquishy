# jQuishy

jQuishy is a superficial replacement for jQuery.  It offers the most common, in my experience, features (sans ajax) used in jQuery. In many projects, this will give you the minimum capabilities needed.  Use it, as a replacement for the full jQuery library.  Below, you can see a list of features, and a description of attributes utilized.  If it fits the parameters of your project, I encourage you to use it with its 2kb footprint.

## Features

- attr
- css
- addClass
- removeClass
- toggleClass
- append
- delegate

## Attributes

jQuishy utilizes aspects of modern JavaScript, namely ES2015.  Below is a list.

- arrow functions
- let and const variable declarations
- template literals
- forEach array method (ES5)
- querySelectorAll selector
- insertAdjacentHTML appender technique

Take note of these features in deciding if this library is appropriate for your project.  In general, support for this library exists in all modern browsers, and from IE9 and up.
